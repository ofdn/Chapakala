# Contributing to Chapakala19

We welcome contributions in design, development, documentation, and testing.  
This project aims to create a high-quality, openly licensed Odia typeface for historical reproduction, everyday use, and OCR training.
The typeface revives the workhorse typeface used by the Orissa Mission Press from 1838.
