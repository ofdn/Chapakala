Chapakala19 revives the typeface used in the Orissa Mission Press, Cuttack, from 1838.  
The press was founded by Rev. Charles Lacey, who brought a hand-operated letterpress from Britain. Orissa Mission Press was the first modern printing press of Orissa (presently, Odisha). Chapakala19 revives a workhorse typeface designed by Manohar Karmakar, son-in-law of Panchanan Karmakar, both goldsmiths and type designers. Panchanan is credited with designing the first typefaces of most South Asian major writing systems, including the type used for the first Odia book, *New Testament*, printed at the Serampore Mission Press in 1811.  Manohar built on Panchanan’s work, adapting his knowledge from other South Asian scripts.

Most original prints survive only as low-resolution scans, whereas printing quality was shaped by the paper, ink, and press technology of that era. Chapakala19 interprets these letterforms for digital use while documenting their historical origin.

# Design Process

## Research
- Collected scans of Odia books printed 1810–1875.
- Traced over 375 glyphs from these books.

## Drawing
- **2024:** First drafts drawn in FontForge by Subhashish Panigrahi.
- **2025:** Redrawn in Glyphs App for precision and OpenType support (based on rules by Dr. Nasim Ali).
- Guidance from Yesha Goshar for design coherence.

## Versions
- Scrap/interim versions may be shared publicly for critique.
- First formal release planned end of 2025.
- Expanded typeface family planned for 2026.

## Challenges
- Poor scan quality of many books.
- Limited knowledge of type design tools at the start.
- Balancing historical accuracy with digital usability.

# Usage

## Everyday Use
Install `.ttf` or `.otf` from `fonts/` folder.  
Works for print and web publishing.

## Historical Retyping
Designed to match 19th-century Odia type. Useful for retyping scanned archives.

## OCR Training
Open-source font data can be used to train Tesseract and ML-based OCR models.  
Goal: improve recognition of 19th–20th century Odia texts.

## Display
Can also be used in posters, graphics, and multimedia.

# Roadmap

## 2025 (Phase 1)
- Release Regular font (OFL).
- Documentation of research and design process.

## 2026 (Phase 2)
- Add another font from Odia letterpress widely used in the 1900s.
- Expand to family (possibly, Regular, Italic, Bold).

## Future
- Encourage revivals of other Indian script letterpress fonts.
- Use fonts for OCR training datasets.
