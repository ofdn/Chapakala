**Chapakala** (**ଛାପାକଳ**) (“printing press” in Odia) is an open-source typeface family that revives the letterpress-era typefaces used for printing in the Odia (formerly Oriya) script. Each subproject focuses on a distinct historical period of Odia type design.

The first release, **Chapakala19**, revives the 19th-century workhorse used in Odia publications at the Orissa Mission Press. Future subfolders (e.g., `20/`) will expand this family with other revivals.
