**Chapakala** ("printing press" in Odia) is an open source typeface family, reviving the letterpress-era typefaces used for printing in the Oriya (now, Odia) script. The first typeface to be released in Chapakala19.

# Chapakala19

**Chapakala19** revives the workhorse typeface used for over five decades since 1838, when the Orissa Mission Press in Cuttack was founded. The name combines *chapakala* (printing press, a word born in the letterpress era) and *19* (19th-century).  

The original type was designed by Manohar Karmakar, son-in-law of Panchanan Karmakar, pioneers of South Asian type design.
